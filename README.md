# Speech Analysis & Recognition Using Python  

This repository contains an **audio processing and speech recognition** pipeline using **Librosa** and **Deep Learning** techniques. The project focuses on **waveform analysis, spectrogram generation, and feature extraction (MFCCs)** for speech recognition tasks.

## 🚀 Features  
- **Waveform Visualization** to analyze speech signals.  
- **Spectrogram & Mel-Frequency Spectrogram (Mel-Spectrogram) Generation**.  
- **MFCC Feature Extraction** for audio classification and speech recognition.  
- **Python & Librosa-based processing pipeline** for speech analysis.

## 📌 Installation  
### 1️⃣ Clone the repository  
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Speech_Analysis_Recognition.git
cd Speech_Analysis_Recognition
### 2️⃣ Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv speech_env
source speech_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: speech_env\Scripts\activate
### 3️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# 🛠 Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook
Open Speech_analysis_and_recognition.ipynb and execute the cells to process audio files, extract features, and visualize the results.

# 🔍 How It Works
Load Audio Files:

Uses Librosa to load speech recordings.

Waveform & Spectrogram Generation:

Waveform visualization to analyze audio signals.

Spectrogram & Mel-Spectrogram for frequency-domain analysis.

MFCC Feature Extraction:

Extracts Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), crucial for speech recognition.

Optional: Speech Classification & Recognition:

The extracted features can be used for speech classification, speaker identification, or ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) using machine learning models.

# 📊 Analysis
Compares different audio feature representations (Waveform, Spectrogram, MFCCs).

Demonstrates preprocessing steps for speech recognition applications.
